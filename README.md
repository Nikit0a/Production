The project aims to determine a person's emotional state and direct them to a corresponding webpage. For instance, 
if anger is chosen, the webpage will play soothing music and control a LED cube to change colors, displaying yellow-white, which is a calming color. 
This entire system will be operated through a Raspberry Pi. The project's objective is to assist individuals in managing intense emotions.
